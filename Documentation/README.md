# Alternative Prototype Board for Benchduino
 
www.hamradioworkbench.com has designed and sells a general purpose development
board for Microcontrollers. They have provided the designs for both the CPU
Daughterboards as wells as the addon Prototype board.

This directory contains a schematic (pdf format) and a partial BOM in Digikey format. 
It is not complete (I did not itemize the pin headers), I also figured you
had your own source for ceramic caps and film resistors.  Some of the parts I actually 
purchased from Amazon so was not confident that I could select the correct Digikey part.

There is absolutely no warranty here. Use this at your own risk!
