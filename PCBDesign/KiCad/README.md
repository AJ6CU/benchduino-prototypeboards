# Alternative Prototype Board for Benchduino
 
www.hamradioworkbench.com has designed and sells a general purpose development
board for Microcontrollers. They have provided the designs for both the CPU
Daughterboards as wells as the addon Prototype board.

This directory contains a zip file of a KiCad archive of the project. You should be
able to expand it on your system and open up the project file and start modifying it.

There is absolutely no warranty here. Use this at your own risk!

This is now a 2 layer board and much less expensive to get produced. For example, 
JLCPCB only charged me $8.50 for 5 boards.
