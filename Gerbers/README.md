# Alternative Prototype Board for Benchduino
 
www.hamradioworkbench.com has designed and sells a general purpose development
board for Microcontrollers. They have provided the designs for both the CPU
Daughterboards as wells as the addon Prototype board.

This directory includes a zip file that you should be able to upload to your favorite 
Fab house.


There is absolutely no warranty here. Use this at your own risk!

BTW: JCLPCB charges a $35 engineering fee for this board because it is 4 layer and
greater than 100mm x 100mm. Perhaps someone wants to rework it into a 2 layer board?
