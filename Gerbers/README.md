# Alternative Prototype Board for Benchduino
 
www.hamradioworkbench.com has designed and sells a general purpose development
board for Microcontrollers. They have provided the designs for both the CPU
Daughterboards as wells as the addon Prototype board.

This directory includes a zip file that you should be able to upload to your favorite 
Fab house.


There is absolutely no warranty here. Use this at your own risk!

This is now a 2 layer board and much less expensive to produce. Although JLCPCB will still 
charge a small engineering fee, I was able to purchase 5 boards for $8.50 (USD)
